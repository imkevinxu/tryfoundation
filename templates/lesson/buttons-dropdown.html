<h5>Dropdowns &amp; Splits</h5>

<p>Making dropdown buttons is super easy. Just taking an existing button, and add <kbd>.dropdown</kbd> to it. This styles the button properly, but you'll have to use the <a target="_blank" href="http://foundation.zurb.com/docs/components/dropdown.html">dropdown plugin</a> for the dropdown content itself.</p>

<p>Similarly, if you want a split button (the left side is a button and the right side is a dropdown), just add <kbd>.split</kbd> to an existing button, and inside of the button, add an empty <kbd>span</kbd> tag.</p>

<p>Try making a dropdown or a split button in the editor.</p>
